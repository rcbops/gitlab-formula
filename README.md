# gitlab-formula
This GitLab Formula is based on the GitLab Omnibus installer for Ubuntu 12.04. https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/.
After the formula runs, the GitLab server is configured and uses Postfix. 

After installing GitLab, browse to the hostname and login:

Username: root

Password: 5iveL!fe 

After loging in, you will have to change the default password.
